# How We Saved 4,620 Designer Hours Using AI Workflow

Rebranding 14,000 packaging labels is no small task. That would’ve consumed 4,620 designer hours.

But with [smart automation](https://5flow.eu/artwork-management/), and AI, 5Flow delivered the project on time, at scale, and without compromising accuracy.

This is a real-world example of AI in action, solving creative production challenges at scale.

**Context**

In today’s fast-moving consumer goods landscape, brands face growing pressure to communicate clearly and responsibly with consumers, especially around recycling and sustainability.

That’s why GreenBlue’s How2Recycle® program recently launched its [updated How2Recycle Pro Label](https://greenblue.org/projects/how2recycle/how2recycle-forward-label/#:~:text=The%20How2Recycle%20Pro%20Label,new%20How2Recycle%20Pro%20label%20design.), designed to provide clearer, more actionable guidance for consumers.

**The challenge**:

For How2Recycle, the ambition was clear, but the execution was daunting.

- 14,000 unique label variations needed to be redesigned, validated, and delivered
- Completing this manually would have required thousands of designer hours.
- The launch deadline was at risk without an automated solution. That’s where 5Flow came in.

**The solution**:

We realized it wasn’t a design problem: it was a data and pattern recognition challenge. Each label contained repeatable elements that could be intelligently recognized and reused. With an automation-first mindset, we built a custom [**artwork Management solution**](https://5flow.eu/wave/) to solve this project.

**Step 1**: Label segmentation: We developed a pixel identification algorithm that broke down each label into four core components: (1) instruction, (2) logo type, (3) material, (4) component.

**Step 2**: Smart matching: Tiles were automatically checked against a central database. Matches were pulled instantly; new ones were read with OCR (optical character recognition) and stored with a unique code via our management solution**.**

This created a central database that eliminated duplicate work and ensured efficiency.

**Step 3**: Automatic generation:

Updated PDFs were generated automatically in the new design template, guaranteeing accuracy, consistency, and speed across thousands of assets.

**The Results**

- 14,000 labels converted on time
- 4,620 designer hours saved
- 81% efficiency gain, translating into cost savings
