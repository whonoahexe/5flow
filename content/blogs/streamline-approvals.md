Speed matters when you’re launching products. But approval cycles often drag due to unclear ownership, scattered feedback, and version confusion.

In this guide, we break down a simple framework for faster, more reliable approvals:

1. Define entry criteria (what’s required before review starts)
2. Use structured checklists per team (brand, regulatory, print)
3. Centralize feedback with versioned annotations
4. Automate routing based on SKU/market
5. Measure cycle time and remove bottlenecks

Adopting these steps can cut days from each iteration while increasing quality and compliance.
