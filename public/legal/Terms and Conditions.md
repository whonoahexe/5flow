The Customer may use WAVE to control its internal business processes as part of its design lifecycle management process from ideation to the finished print product. The user enters projects in WAVE and applies predefined workflows to these projects. In the process, project-relevant data is uploaded to the system and made available for an approval process. 5Flow license model is based on number of Project Items (as defined below) that the Customer processes through WAVE each year. The Customer's maximum annual number of Project Items is specified in Customer's Order. The end-to-end execution of a single project under one WAVE ID through a predefined workflow in WAVE is deemed one (1) project item ("Project Item"). The number of users is not limited and is included in the license fee.   5Flow also offers optional extended modules to enhance the functionality of WAVE. Any extended modules to which Customer subscribes during the term of this Agreement shall be described in Customer’s Order.    5Flow hereby grants to Customer, subject to the terms of this Agreement, the right to use WAVE and each extended module listed in Customer’s Order (including, at no additional charge, all releases and enhancements made available to 5Flow’s customers during the subscription term set forth in Customer’s Order (the “Subscription Term”); provided, however, that Customer shall be responsible for the cost of any Professional Services (as defined below) related to the configuration of a new release or enhancement.

| (3)             WAVE is deemed to be provisioned for production use when 5Flow notifies the Customer that the Customer's access to the functional WAVE portal has been activated and that WAVE is functioning in accordance with Customer’s functional specifications detailed in the applicable workflow design document agreed to by Customer and 5Flow.  Prior to confirming WAVE activation, 5Flow and Customer shall carry out a system acceptance test and record any deviations in a system acceptance report. Customer's continued production use of WAVE following the system acceptance test will serve as Customer's acceptance of WAVE. |

(3)             The Receiving Party acknowledges that any unauthorized disclosure of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information will result in irreparable injury to the Disclosing Party that would not be adequately compensated by the payment of money damages. In addition to any other legal and equitable remedies that may be available, the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek injunctive relief against any breach or threatened breach by the Receiving Party of the confidentiality obligations hereunder, from any court of competent jurisdiction, without being required to show any actual damage or irreparable harm, to prove the inadequacy of its legal remedies, or to post any bond or other security.

| (1)             5Flow shall provide ongoing maintenance services for WAVE during the Subscription Term. 5Flow will install available patches, updates, and enhancements for WAVE released to all WAVE customers (each an "Update"), but any assistance with the configuration of WAVE or technical service following and Update shall be the subject of a separate Professional Services Order.    |
| (2)             5Flow shall have a time window of four (4) hours per month available for maintenance work, which it may plan freely (“Planned Downtime”). Maintenance work shall, as far as possible, be carried out outside the Base Period (as defined in Section IX(1) below) unless it has to be carried out immediately, e.g. for the purpose of an emergent security threat or vulnerability or for fault clearance (“Emergency Downtime”). 5Flow will use all reasonable efforts to inform Customer in advance of Planned Downtime.  |

|   |
| **IX              Availability (SLA)**   |
| (1)             5Flow agrees that WAVE shall be available (as defined below) to Customer 24 hours 365 days a year at an availability percentage of least 99% WAVE Platform Availability (as defined below) on an annual average during the hours of 00:00 – 24:00 Monday through Sunday (the “base period”).  “WAVE Platform Availability” means the following criteria are satisfied:   **Accessibility:** A monitored technical user can access WAVE through a web browser without encountering connectivity issues or authentication problems attributed to 5Flow.   **Data Availability:** WAVE data is accessible ensuring that Customer’s users can retrieve and interact with Customer’s information as intended. (data base connectivity)   **Response Time:** Monitored requests responds quickly with minimal latency, ensuring a smooth user experience. (monitored request response time)   User specific system unavailability is covered by service request and not part of the SLA measurement criteria.  |
|   |
| The measurement period is determined according to the following formula:    |
|   |
| WAVE Platform Availability= MinIST / MinBASE x 100   |
|   |
| Where:    |
| ·     MinIST \= The number of minutes of WAVE Platform Availability, plus downtime where WAVE Platform Availability is not achieved due to Force Majeure Events, 5Flow vendors, defects caused by Customer, third party services or equipment, software and technology not under 5Flow’s control, factors outside of 5Flow’s reasonable control, Planned Downtime, Emergency Downtime and downtime due Updates or services requested by Customer. |
| ·     MinBASE \= 525.600 minutes in a year \= The number of minutes of the base period in a year.    |
| (2)             For each minute that 5Flow fails to comply with the guaranteed availability within the base period, it shall owe Customer a credit in the amount of Customer’s annual fees for WAVE as specified in the Order / 525600, but not more than one-twelfth of the annual remuneration pursuant to Section XI per year. No credit shall be provided in an amount less than one dollar USD $1. The billing/settlement shall take place annually on the anniversary of the start of the Subscription Period. The credit cannot be demanded if the customer is then in breach of these Terms and Conditions or the applicable Order. This shall apply in particular if the customer violates the duties to cooperate pursuant to Section X. Credits shall be offset against the customer's claims for damages.   |
| (3)             5Flow shall report the percentage of WAVE Platform Availability to Customer in writing on a quarterly basis. 5Flow’s report of WAVE Platform Availability shall be final and binding on the parties. |
|   |
| **X               Troubleshooting**    |
| (1)             If Customer believes WAVE is failing to perform in accordance with the User Manual (a “Problem”), then Customer’s key users shall report the Problem through the 5Flow online ticketing system along with all information known to it regarding the Problem (“Service Request”). Upon request by 5Flow, the Customer shall assist 5Flow in replicating and diagnosing the Problem by cooperating with 5Flow to take measures within Customer’s sphere of responsibility to enable the identification and analysis of the Problem, e.g. provide necessary individual technical information from Customer’s sphere of responsibility.   |
| (2)             If 5Flow is able to replicate the Problem, the Problem shall be categorized by 5Flow immediately after the receipt of Customer’s Service Request as follows.   |
| ·      Priority Level 1 \- A disruption that prevents all operation of WAVE and no alternative solution ("workaround") is available.   |
| ·      Priority Level 2 \- A malfunction that obstructs significant functionality of WAVE or for which a workaround is available.   |
| ·      Priority Level 3 \- A slight disturbance is present if the use of WAVE is possible without or with insignificant restrictions.   |
| (3)             In the event of Problems, the following response times and recovery time targets shall be agreed.   |

 

| Malfunction | Response Time | Targeted    Resolution Time |   |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Priority Level 1 | 2 hours | 24 hours |   |
| Priority Level 2 | 4 hours | 100 hours |   |
| Priority Level 3 | 24 hours | 200 hours |   |
|   5Flow will use reasonable efforts to acknowledge receipt of Customer’s Service Requests received during the Support Services Window within the Response Time. For Service Requests received outside of Customer’s Support Services Window, the response and recovery time objectives set forth above shall commence upon the start of Customer’s next Support Services Window. If 5Flow is able to replicate the Problem, 5Flow will use commercially reasonable efforts to diagnose the Problem and provide a remedy that could take the form of eliminating the Problem, providing updates, or demonstrating how to avoid the effects of the Problem using a commercially reasonable level of effort. 5Flow shall not be responsible to resolve any Problem which it is unable to replicate after reasonable efforts. Despite 5Flow’s exercise of reasonable efforts, not all Problems may be solvable. The targeted resolution time will start from the date and time when 5Flow acknowledges receipt of the Service Request. If the Service Request cannot be solved within a commercially reasonable timeframe, the Service Request may be escalated within the 5Flow organization. Customer’s designated technical contacts must be available to work with 5Flow while 5Flow is in the process of resolving the Service Request.        **XI              Remuneration and terms of payment**   |  |  |  |
| (1)             The annual subscription fees for the use of WAVE and fees for Professional Services or other services (“Fees”) are specified in the Order. For Subscription Terms longer than twelve months, 5Flow reserves the right to increase the annual subscription Fees by payable by Customer annually; provided, that if the increase amounts to more than five percent (5%) of the then current annual fees, the Customer shall have the right to terminate the Subscription Term. An increase shall be announced to the Customer and shall become effective at the earliest three (3) months after receipt of the notification. If Customer’s payment of Fees is past due or delinquent and Customer fails to pay the Fees after receipt of 5Flow’s notice to Customer of such delinquency, then such non-payment will be considered a material breach by Customer of this Agreement. No refunds or credits for paid Fees will be issued to Customer.  |  |  |  |
| (2)             The stated prices of 5Flow are net prices and are exclusive of the statutory value added tax or withholding tax and other duties, if relevant. Customer is responsible for paying all taxes associated with its subscription to WAVE or any services provided under these Terms and Conditions (other than any taxes which may be assessed on or in respect of 5Flow’s income). |  |  |  |
|   |  |  |  |
| (3)             Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Order, Fees for Customer’s WAVE subscription is due annually in advance. Fees for Professional Services or other services shall be payable as provided in the applicable Order. Unless otherwise stated in the order confirmation, the invoice shall be due for payment net without deduction within thirty (30) days from the invoice date. If circumstances exist which indicate a significant deterioration of Customer's assets, 5Flow shall be entitled to demand advance payments or securities and to refuse the performance of 5Flow's obligations until reasonable advance payment or securities are provided at Customer’s expense. The right to refuse performance shall remain unaffected. In case of default of payment 5Flow shall furthermore be entitled to default interest in the amount of ten percent (10%) above the respective base interest rate, or the maximum interest allowable by law, whichever is lower. Further rights of 5Flow shall remain unaffected.  |  |  |  |
| (4)             If Customer’s usage of WAVE exceeds the usage purchased under an Order (a “True-Up”), 5Flow shall provide written notice that a True-Up may be required and, if Customer does not reduce its usage of WAVE the Solutions to the level purchased under the Order within ten (10) days after the date of such notice, 5Flow  has the right to invoice Customer for the incremental Fees associated with such True-Up (retroactive to the date of 5Flow’s True-Up Notice) on (i) a pro rata basis at the price per unit specified in the applicable Order for the remaining period of such Subscription Term and/or (ii) the overages for usage for the relevant period at the price per unit specified in the applicable Order.  |  |  |  |
| (5)             A payment shall be deemed received as soon as the equivalent amount has been irrevocably credited to one of 5Flow's accounts. Unless a direct debit procedure has been agreed, the invoice amount must be credited to the account specified in the invoice no later than on the fifteenth (15th) day after receipt of the invoice.    |  |  |  |
|   |  |  |  |
| **XII             Intellectual Property**   |  |  |  |
| (1)           As between the Parties: a) Customer reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Customer Data and all patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, trade secrets, and any other form of intellectual property rights recognized in any jurisdiction, including applications and registrations for any of the foregoing (“Intellectual Property Rights”) embodied in Customer Data; b) 5Flow reserves all right, title, and interest in and to WAVE (and any and all modifications to or derivative works of WAVE), User Manual, Deliverables, and any and all Intellectual Property Rights embodied in such.   (2)         Each Party reserves all rights not expressly granted in these Terms and Conditions, and no licenses are granted by one Party to the other Party under these Terms and Conditions and the applicable Order, whether by implication, estoppel or otherwise, except as expressly set forth in these Terms and Conditions.   (3)         5Flow will at its cost and expense: a) defend any claim asserted by a third party against Customer and Customer’s directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, or other authorized representatives (“Customer Indemnitees”) to the extent alleging that Customer’s use of WAVE in accordance with this Agreement and the User Manual infringes or misappropriates a third party’s valid Intellectual Property Rights (“IP Claims”); and (b) pay and indemnify any losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, judgments, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), or expenses of whatever kind,  that are agreed to in a settlement by 5Flow or are finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction as a result of the IP Claims (collectively, “Losses”). In the event of an IP Claim pursuant to this Section XII(3),  5Flow may, at 5Flow’s option and at 5Flow’s expense: (i) obtain for Customer, the right to continue to use WAVE under the subscription granted to Customer under these Terms and Conditions; (ii) substitute the allegedly infringing component for an equivalent non-infringing component; or (iii) modify WAVE to make it non-infringing; provided that any such modifications under this clause (iii) shall provide equivalent functionality and security as the allegedly infringing WAVE.  If the options set forth in Section XII(3) (i), (ii), or (iii) are not obtainable on commercially reasonable terms, 5Flow may terminate these Terms and Conditions and the applicable Order and will refund to Customer all prepaid applicable for WAVE attributable to the remainder of the Subscription Term (as outlined in the applicable Order) following the termination of this Agreement.   (4)             5Flow’s indemnification obligations do not extend to IP Claims or Losses arising from or relating to: (a) any act or omission of any Customer Indemnitees in breach of these Terms and Conditions or the Order; (b) any combination of WAVE (or any portion thereof) by any Customer Indemnitees or any third party with any equipment, software, data, or any other materials where the infringement would not have occurred but for such combination; (c) any IP Claims related to OSS; (d) any modification to WAVE by any Customer Indemnitees or any third party where the infringement would not have occurred but for such modification; (e) the use of WAVE by any Customer Indemnitees or any third party in a manner contrary to the terms of this these Terms and Conditions and the Order where the infringement would not have occurred but for such use; or (f) the continued use of WAVE after 5Flow has provided an substantially  equivalent non-infringing software or service.   (5)             Customer will at its cost and expense defend any claim asserted by a third party against 5Flow and its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, or other authorized representatives (“5Flow Indemnitees”) to the extent arising from (a) Customer’s use of WAVE in breach of these Terms and Conditions or the Order; (b) Customer’s unauthorized use of any third party intellectual property (other than IP Claims); or (c) Customer’s breach of the Restrictions (“5Flow Indemnity Claims”); and (ii) pay and indemnify any losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, judgments, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), or expenses of whatever kind, that are agreed to in a settlement by Customer or are finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction as a result of the 5Flow Indemnity Claims.   (6)             The indemnifying Party’s indemnification obligations under this Section XII for any claim covered under Sections XII (3) or (4)  (“Claim”) are conditioned upon the indemnified Party: (a) giving prompt written notice of the Claim to the indemnifying Party once the indemnified Party becomes aware of the Claim (provided that failure to provide prompt written notice to the indemnifying Party will not alleviate an indemnifying Party’s obligations under this Section XII to the extent any associated delay does not materially prejudice or impair the defense of the related Claims); (b) granting the indemnifying Party the option to take sole control of the defense (including granting the indemnifying Party the right to select and use counsel of its own choosing) and settlement of the Claim (except that the indemnified Party’s prior written approval will be required for any settlement that reasonably can be expected to require an affirmative obligation of the indemnified Party or which contains an admission of fault or wrongdoing by the indemnified Party or its respective Indemnitees); and (c) providing reasonable cooperation to the indemnifying Party and, at the indemnifying Party’s request and expense, assistance in the defense or settlement of the IP Claim or 5Flow Indemnity Claim, as the case may be.   |  |  |  |
| **XIII           Limitation on Liability**   |  |  |  |

| (2)             5Flow and its affiliates shall only be liable in accordance with the statutory provisions in cases of wilful misconduct or gross negligence; in case of slight negligence, however, 5Flow shall only be liable in cases involving injury to life, body and health.    |  |  |  |
| (3)             The maximum cumulative liability of 5Flow and its affiliates to Customer under these Terms and Conditions shall be limited to the lesser of (a) 50% of the annual Fees payable for the disputed service as specified in the Order and (b) €500,000. In case of loss of data resulting from problems outside of 5Flow, 5Flow's liability shall be limited to providing the backups then available. Compensation for data loss not covered by the backup is excluded. |  |  |  |
| (4)              In no event with 5Flow or any of its affiliates be liable for any consequential, indirect, exemplary, special, or incidental damages, including any lost data, lost profits or cost of procurement of substitute services arising from or relating to these Terms and Conditions even if 5Flow has been advised on the possibility of such damages.   |  |  |  |
| **XIV           Force majeure**    |  |  |  |
| (1)             Except for payments of Fees due, neither Party will be responsible for any failure to perform or delay attributable in whole or in part to any cause or event beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God (e.g., fire, storm, floods, earthquakes, etc.), civil disturbances, disruption of telecommunications, disruption of power or other essential services, cyberattacks or other interruptions or terminations of service by or against any service providers used by 5Flow, labor disturbances, vandalism, cable cuts, or any malicious or unlawful acts of any third party.  |  |  |  |
| (2)              Each Contracting Party shall notify the other Contracting Party of the occurrence of a case of force majeure immediately and in writing. |  |  |  |
| **XV                   Commencement and term of contract, termination**    |  |  |  |
| (1)             The contractual relationship and the Subscription Term begins when both parties sign the Order and run for an initial contract period of thirty-six (36) months. Upon the expiration of the initial Subscription Term specified in the applicable Order, the Subscription Term shall automatically renew for additional periods of one (1) year unless Customer provides 5Flow with written notice of its election not to renew at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the then-current Subscription Term. Subscription Fees for any renewal term shall be at 5Flow’s then current rates, subject to 5Flow's rights under Section XI(1) above.  |  |  |  |
| (2)              If either party commits a material breach of these Terms and Conditions or the Order, the non-breaching party may give written notice describing the nature and basis of the breach to the breaching party. If the breach is not cured within thirty (30) days of the notice date, the non-breaching party may immediately terminate these Terms and Conditions and all Orders issued hereunder.    |  |  |  |
| (3)             All notices of termination must be in writing.    |  |  |  |
| (4)             Upon effectiveness of the termination or upon other termination of the contract, all rights of use granted on the basis of this contract shall expire.    |  |  |  |
| (5)             5Flow shall have no obligation to store Customer Data longer than five (5) years after the date it was first submitted to WAVE. At any time up to sixty (60) days after termination of the Subscription Term Customer may request the return of the Customer Data then stored in WAVE in an orderly, digital form. Upon the Customer's request, 5Flow shall immediately create corresponding data carriers and hand them over to the Customer or make the data available electronically (e.g. by download link). Expenses incurred by 5Flow for the first data handover shall be compensated by as specified in a separate Professional Services Order. Customer shall remunerate 5Flow for any further handover as agreed, provided that 5Flow is not responsible for the further request for handover.  Following sixty (60) days after termination of the Subscription Term, 5Flow shall have no obligation to retain any Customer Data. |  |  |  |
| (6)             5Flow shall not be obliged to support the Client in transferring the contents and data to another system after termination of these Terms and Conditions. Any such transition services shall be provided in 5Flow’s sole discretion and documented in a separate Order. |  |  |  |
| **XVI                  Final Provisions**   |  |  |  |
| (1)             5Flow shall be entitled to assign or delegate its rights or obligations under this contract in whole or in part to third parties.   |  |  |  |
| (2)             Customer may not assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, without 5Flow's prior written consent, except that Customer may assign this Agreement in whole to an affiliate or successor in interest as part of a corporate reorganization, consolidation, merger or sale of all or substantially all of its assets; provided that the successor to Customer is not a direct competitor of 5Flow. Customer will notify 5Flow upon completion of any permitted assignment. Any attempted assignment in violation of the above provisions shall be invalid.   |  |  |  |
| (3)             Any notice given under these Terms and Conditions must be in writing by email to the addresses specified in the applicable Order (or addresses notified in writing by either Party).  |  |  |  |
| (4)             Except to the extent of any credits issued by 5Flow pursuant to Section IX(2) above, Customer's liability to 5Flow under these Terms and Conditions or any Order is not subject to set-off for any amounts due Customer.   |  |  |  |
| (5)             Actual or threatened breach of certain sections of these Terms and Conditions (such as, without limitation, provisions on intellectual property (including ownership), license, privacy, data protection and confidentiality) may cause immediate, irreparable harm that is difficult to calculate and cannot be remedied by the payment of damages alone. Either party will be entitled to seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and other equitable relief for any such breach.  |  |  |  |
| (6)             If Customer is in in Europe (ex. United Kingdom), Africa or the Middle East, these Terms and Conditions shall be governed by the laws of Germany. If Customer is in the United Kingdom, Asia, Australia, or Oceania these Terms and Conditions shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales. If Customer is in North America or South America, these Terms and Conditions shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal laws of the United States of America. The applicability of the CISG is excluded. If these Terms and Conditions or an Order are translated into multiple languages than the German language version shall take precedence over the other translation.  The parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of competent jurisdiction in the location of the 5Flow regional Customer Support Center to which Customer is assigned, provided however, 5Flow will have the right to pursue claims against Customer in any other jurisdiction worldwide to enforce its rights under these Terms and Conditions or to enforce its intellectual property rights.  |  |  |  |
| (7)             Neither Party’s waiver of the breach of any provision constitutes a waiver of that provision in any other instance. This Agreement may not be modified nor any rights under it waived, in whole or in part, except in writing signed by the Parties.  |  |  |  |
| (8)             WAVE and all other products or services that 5Flow may provide or make available to Customer for use by Customer’s users are subject to U.S. export control and economic sanctions laws, including the Export Administration Regulations and trade and economic sanctions imposed by Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”).  Customer agrees not to violate such laws and regulations as they relate to Customer’s access to and use of WAVE. Customer shall not access or use WAVE if Customer is located in any jurisdiction in which the provision of WAVE is prohibited under U.S. or other applicable laws or regulations, (each, a “Prohibited Jurisdiction”), and Customer agrees not to permit access to WAVE to any government, entity, or individual located in any Prohibited Jurisdiction, or to any person or entity currently included on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List or the Consolidated Sanctions List maintained by OFAC (“Prohibited Person”), or to any other person or entity in violation of any U.S. or other applicable export laws, regulations, embargoes, prohibitions, or restrictions. Customer agrees to comply with all applicable laws regarding the export or re-export of technology from the U.S. and the country in which Customer and users are located. Customer represents and warrants that neither Customer nor any of Customer’s affiliates is an entity that (i) is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by any person or entity currently included on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List or the Consolidated Sanctions List maintained by OFAC, or (ii) is located in, or is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by any entity or individual located in, any Prohibited Jurisdiction. (9)         Neither Party will, for any purpose, be deemed to be an agent, franchisor, franchise, employee, representative, owner or partner of the other Party, and the relationship between the Parties will only be that of independent contractors. Neither Party will have any right or authority to assume or create any obligations or to make any representations or warranties on behalf of any other Party, whether express or implied, or to bind the other Party in any respect whatsoever. (10)       Should individually provisions of these Terms and Conditions be invalid, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. In this case, the parties shall cooperate to replace invalid provisions with provisions that correspond as closely as possible to the invalid provisions.   |  |  |  |
