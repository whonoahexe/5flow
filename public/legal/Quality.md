**5Flow Quality Policy**

At 5Flow we are committed to ensuring an ongoing positive experience for our customers, suppliers and staff by encouraging a cooperative and communicative environment between all parties.

We take pride in the service that we provide and we work closely with our customers to understand their business needs and provide services and products that enhance the quality of their business operations. We recognise that the true measure of our service will always be judged through the eyes of our customers; the confidence that our customers have in our services and in our staff, ultimately defines the success of our business. 

It is our policy to maintain and develop systems which aim to continually improve the performance of our business and to ensure that our services fulfil the requirements of our customers as well as any statutory or regulatory requirements. We continually review and improve these systems for suitability and effectiveness to ensure that the business objectives are met. 

The company provides all necessary resources for the fulfilment of the quality, occupational health and safety objectives and the enforcement of this policy.

5Flow is committed to the continuous improvement and development of the quality, occupational health and safety system and compliance with valid environmental protection requirements.

We strive for the involvement of all employees in the drive for excellence in our business as we believe that the abilities, knowledge, and experience of our staff are our most valuable resource. Our goal is that all our staff are empowered to be proactive in supporting continuous improvement, to initiate actions to prevent non-conformance, to identify and record quality and safety problems and recommend solutions or improvements. 

   
 

 

Acting in a quality- and safety-conscious manner also means using valuable (environmental) resources efficiently and sparingly. Every employee has the duty and the right to work towards eliminating circumstances that prevent the production and organisation of services of impeccable quality based on the requirements they have set themselves.

Managers are committed to applying the QM and safety measures applicable in their area of responsibility and to paying attention to occupational safety, constantly monitoring their effectiveness, and adapting them to the latest knowledge and requirements. This awareness as well as the attitude of all employees towards quality and safety are prerequisites for customer satisfaction and thus for the lasting success of the company.
