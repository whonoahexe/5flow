b) We process personal data that we have obtained from business relationships (such as with customers or suppliers) or inquiries. We usually receive this data directly from the contractual partner or an inquiring person. However, personal data may also originate from public sources (e.g. commercial register), provided that the processing of such data is permitted. Data may also have been legitimately transmitted to us by other companies, as well as affiliated companies. Depending on the individual case, we also store our own information on this data (e.g. as part of an ongoing business relationship). 

## **3\. For what purposes and on what legal basis do we process personal data?**  

We process personal data in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR and national data protection legislation:  

**a) In the context of the performance of a contract or for the execution of pre-contractual measures (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b) GDPR)**  

We process personal data primarily for the fulfillment of contractual obligations and the provision of related services or in the context of a corresponding contract initiation (e.g. contract negotiations, preparation of offers). The specific purposes here depend on the respective service or product to which the business relationship or contract initiation relates, in particular in connection with orders from customers and orders placed with suppliers, service partners. Furthermore, we process your data in processing the services provided, in particular invoicing, accounts receivable management, dunning and collection.  

The data processing serves the following purposes in particular:  

* Initiation, execution and processing of purchase orders and production orders, logistics and customs management   
* administration of customer data, for the processing of payments and, if necessary, for credit checks. Certain shipping data is provided to the authorities of the transit or destination country \- depending on the relevant legal requirements \- for the purpose of customs clearance and taxation or for security checks. Such data usually includes the name and address of the sender, name and address of the recipient, description of goods, number of pieces, weight and value of the shipment.   
* Communication with customers, service providers, subcontractors, business partners as well as authorities   
* Support, in particular answering inquiries from our contact persons, interested parties, customers or partners

For this processing, there is a legitimate interest on the part of the responsible parties with regard to ensuring a smooth process as well as the continuous improvement of the respective products and services. In the opinion of the data controller, there is no predominant interest of the data subjects that is worthy of protection, since the intensity of the processing is kept as low as possible, e.g. by using pseudonyms. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 para.1 lit. f) GDPR.   
* Settling legal disputes, enforcing existing contracts, and asserting, exercising, and defending legal claims.   
* Maintaining and protecting the security of our systems and the Company's IT operations.

Likewise, the processing of personal data insofar as this is necessary for the implementation of technical and organizational measures pursuant to Art. 32 GDPR.  

**d) Based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR)**  

Insofar as you have given us consent in individual cases to process personal data for specific purposes (e.g. film and photo recordings, newsletter subscription), the lawfulness of this processing is based on your consent. You may revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future.
